# User Profile Webpage

This project is a **User Profile Webpage** that dynamically fetches user data from an API using **Redux** for state management. It ensures efficient data handling and UI updates while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Features

- Fetches user details from an API dynamically.
- Utilizes **Redux** for state management.
- Manages loading and error states efficiently.
- Optimized for performance and scalability.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-profile-webpage.git
cd user-profile-webpage

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or yarn install

# Start the development server
npm start  # or yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
# Runs the app in development mode
npm start

# Launches the test runner
npm test

# Builds the app for production
npm run build

# Removes the single build dependency (use with caution!)
npm run eject
```

## State Management with Redux

This application leverages **Redux** to manage state efficiently. Key aspects include:

- **Actions & Reducers:** Handle API calls, user information storage, and UI state management.
- **Redux Thunk or Redux Toolkit:** Middleware for handling asynchronous API requests.
- **Selectors:** Optimize state access for better performance.

## API Integration

The app fetches user data from a public API (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`). You can replace this with your preferred API source.

## Deployment

To deploy the app:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy using Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting service
```
